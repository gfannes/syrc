# Client
- [x] Measure/print duration
- [x] Rework comm to use `std.Io.Reader/Writer` iso generic
	- Add `flush()` where necessary
- Copy data from netstream directly to file iso buffer
- [x] Fix running in fast mode wrt Error.ExpectedChecksum
	- Issue was incorrect setup of `?[32]u8`
- [x] Support running rake commands in non-git copy of root-all
- [x] Fix failing `rake ut` due to missing `core/vlc/extern/lvgl/conf/lv_conf.h` in copied folder
	- Reworked existing .gitignore files
- [x] Export CSV with collected file info to reduce loaded file sizes
- [x] Print output in client
- [*] Reduce 10GB data that is loaded for root-all
	- Remove `cli/espcap_ahp/qc/scenario_espcap_v2/auro-440/bianca/FhG_src_drop_renderers_v1.0.0_20180828_0bfbf8ce.zip`
	- Many `.wav` files
- [x] Fix `rake ut[core/audio]` over syrc
	- Due to missing `sine440.wav`
- [x] Rework protocol to support early sending of items
	- Main use case is a large tree with just a few updates
		- Send FileState during discovery
		- Do not send Missing/Content while still receiving FileStates
- [x] Implement Collect
- [x] Support for reusing an existing tree without removal
- Reuse object files by moving the cache outside of core/build/cache/cook
- [ ] Create tree state
	- [x] List all files
		- [x] Basic walking of CWD in [[app.zig]]
	- [x] Add attribute info
	- [ ] Add additional files/folders with `.syrc` files, next to `.ignore` and `.gitignore` that overrule these
	- [x] Add checksum info
		- Blake3 at 128bit is secure enough, faster and shorter
		- [ ] Use a thread pool directly to queue the checksum tasks
			- [ ] Limit the queue size with a semaphore, by default to the CPU count
		- Read files into buffers
			- Is this faster MT?
		- Compute checksum
			- Is this faster MT?
- [x] Support cleanup blob.Store
- [x] Integrate Store into runTest()
	- [x] Create in rubr.fs.homeDir()/.config/syrc
	- [x] Use [32]u8 iso [64]u8 as Key in Store: couple with crypto.Checksum
	- [x] Implement basic API: check for content, add and extract
	- [x] Compute missing content when receiving a Replicate command
	- [x] Support bidirectional comms in runTest()
		- Use localhost stream
